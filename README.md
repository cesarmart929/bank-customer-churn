My name is Cesar Martinez, and I created this repository to showcase my first data analyst portfolio project. I downloaded a free public dataset from Maven Analytics, a data analytics learning provider, and completed the recommended analysis. The dataset, Bank Customer Churn, provides the age, gender, region, and several other factors for each of a bank's 10,000 customers. Though not explicitly stated, it is assumed that the bank in question is fictitious. I will answer four questions in turn--each provided by Maven.

1. What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners? Can churn be predicted using the variables in the data? (Churners vs. Non-Churners)
2. What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like? (Demographics)
3. Is there a difference between German, French, and Spanish customers in terms of account behavior? (Behavior by Region)
4. What types of segments exist within the bank's customers? (Customer Segmentation)

Churners vs. Non-Churners--

  When analyzing the characteristics of churners vs non-churners, several patterns emerge. Firstly, the average age of churners was 8 years greater than the average age of non-churners. Second, on average, churners balances â‚¬20,000 more than non-churners. Third, 55% of non-churners were active members of the bank while only 35% of churners were the same. Fourth, 1 in 4 females churned while only 16% of males churned. Fifth and finally, while only 16% of French and Spanish members churned, a whopping 32% of German members churned.
  
  Based on these patterns, there is much investigation to be done into the underlyting causes for churning. Why is it that those who churn are likelier to be older than those who do not? Are members with larger account balances churning due to the opportunity cost of potentially earning more in interest at other banks? Why are females churning so much, and what is happening in Germany that is causing double the amount of churning when compared to elsewhere?

Demographics--

  Half of this bank's customers are French while Spanish and German customers make up a quarter of the total each. It is likely then that this is a French bank. Nearly 55% of the bank's customers are male. This figure coupled with the fact that 1 in 4 females are churners indicates that the bank is lagging in attracting and retaning female customers. The average age of the bank's customers is nearly 39 years.
